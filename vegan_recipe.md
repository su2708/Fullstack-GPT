**Ingredients Required:**

*For the main dish (Vegetarian Greek Moussaka):*  
- 3 medium eggplants, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds  
- 1 pound lentils (cooked) or 1 cup of finely chopped mushrooms (like cremini)  
- 1 large onion, diced  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes  
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste  
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano  
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon  
- 1/2 teaspoon salt  
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced  
- 1 cup béchamel sauce (made with plant-based milk and flour)  
- 1 cup grated plant-based cheese or nutritional yeast for topping  

*For the salad:*  
- 1 head of romaine lettuce, chopped  
- 1 cucumber, diced  
- 2 large tomatoes, diced  
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced  
- 1/2 cup Kalamata olives  
- 1 block (4 oz) plant-based feta cheese, crumbled  
- 1/4 cup olive oil  
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  
- Salt and pepper to taste  

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Eggplants:**  
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).  
   - Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Rinse and pat dry.  
   - Brush the eggplants with olive oil and arrange them on a baking sheet. Roast for about 20-25 minutes until they are softened and slightly golden. 

2. **Cook the Lentil or Mushroom Sauce:**  
   - In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions and sauté until translucent.  
   - Add minced garlic and cook for another minute.  
   - If using lentils, add them directly into the skillet and stir. If using mushrooms, add them and cook until they release moisture and become tender.  
   - Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until the sauce thickens. 

3. **Assemble the Moussaka:**  
   - In a large baking dish, place a layer of potato slices at the bottom.  
   - Add half of the lentil or mushroom sauce, followed by a layer of roasted eggplants. Repeat with the remaining sauce and eggplants, finishing with a layer of the remaining potato slices.  
   - Pour the homemade or store-bought béchamel sauce over the top and sprinkle with grated plant-based cheese or nutritional yeast. 

4. **Bake the Moussaka:**  
   - Lower the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake the moussaka for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let sit for 10 minutes before slicing.

5. **Prepare the Greek Salad:**  
   - In a large bowl, combine chopped romaine lettuce, diced cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, olives, and plant-based feta cheese. 
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

**Serving Suggestions:**  
- Serve the vegetarian moussaka warm, garnished with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or additional plant-based cheese if desired.  
- Pair with the Greek salad on the side for a refreshing contrast.  
- For an extra touch, serve with fresh pita bread and a vegan tzatziki sauce made from vegan yogurt, cucumber, garlic, and dill for dipping.  
- Enjoy with a glass of Greek red wine for a complete dining experience!

**Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:**  
1. *Ground Beef or Lamb* was replaced with cooked lentils or finely chopped mushrooms, which provide a hearty texture and are high in protein while being plant-based.  
2. *Béchamel Sauce* made with dairy was substituted with a plant-based version using plant milk and flour to maintain creaminess without animal products.  
3. *Kefalotyri or Parmesan Cheese* was replaced with grated plant-based cheese or nutritional yeast, which adds a similar cheesy flavor without the dairy.  
4. *Feta Cheese* was replaced with plant-based feta, ensuring the salad remains delicious while staying completely vegetarian.  

These substitutions maintain the authentic taste and essence of the traditional moussaka and salad.
